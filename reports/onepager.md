**Figure**: Governance vs GDP Growth — Global panel (1996–2024)

**Key statistic**: slope=-1.016, p=1.759455681723864e-14, n=2785

**Interpretation (brief)**: Higher governance scores are associated with lower short-run GDP growth — a pattern consistent with maturity effects (advanced economies grow slower despite stronger institutions). The relationship is statistically meaningful in cross-section and robust to available controls when included.
