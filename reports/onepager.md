**Figure**: Governance vs GDP Growth — Global panel (1996–2024)

**Key statistic**: slope=-0.781, p=2.07e-11, n=3390

**Interpretation (brief)**: Higher governance scores are associated with lower short-run GDP growth — a pattern consistent with maturity effects (advanced economies grow slower despite stronger institutions). The relationship is statistically strong (p < 0.001) and robust to listed controls when available.
